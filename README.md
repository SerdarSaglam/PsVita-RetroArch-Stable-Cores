# PsVita RetroArch Stable Cores
Backing up kernels that work smoothly.

RetroArch 1.17 Fbneo kernel keeps crashing, Fbneo core in Retroarch old 1.15 version works smoothly.

It works smoothly with kernel 1.17 over 1.15. For a much better experience in some games, reduce the CPU clock to 50% in Fbneo core settings. Games run smoothly and sounds are not distorted.

Of course, you need to find a different CPU clock setting for each game.

I just tested it, no more crashes and everything is smooth.
